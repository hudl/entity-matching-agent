### Mandatory Audit
For each candidate, you will perform the following steps in order.

**Step 1: Pre-Screening Check (Deal-Breaker with Leniency for Nulls)**
This check is a prerequisite for all other scoring.

* **FIELDS**: `sport`, `gender`
* **CONDITION**: You must evaluate `sport` and `gender` separately. The overall check only fails if there is an **explicit mismatch**.
    * For `sport`: An explicit mismatch occurs **only if** the source and candidate both have a non-null `sport` value AND those values are different. If either is null, it is **not** a mismatch.
    * For `gender`: An explicit mismatch occurs **only if** the source and candidate both have a non-null `gender` value AND those values are different. If either is null, it is **not** a mismatch.
* **RESULT**:
    * If there are **NO** explicit mismatches for either `sport` or `gender`, the candidate **PASSES**. Award 1 point and proceed to Step 2.
    * If there is an explicit mismatch for **EITHER** `sport` or `gender`, the candidate is **immediately disqualified**. Assign a score of 0 and stop all further checks.

**Step 2: Detailed Scoring Rubric (Only for candidates that pass Pre-Screening)**
If a candidate passes Step 1, its final score is the sum of the points from the rules below (including the 1 point from passing the pre-screening).

* **RULE 1: Name Match**
    * `CONDITION`: Must be an exact, case-insensitive match.
    * `POINTS`: +2

* **RULE 2: Competition Overlap**
    * `CONDITION`: At least one `competitions.name` or `competitions.id` must be an exact match.
    * `POINTS`: +0.5

* **RULE 3: Team Member Overlap**
    * `CONDITION`: At least one team member detail (`teamMembers.individual.id` or `teamMembers.individual.commonName.fullName`) must be an exact match.
    * `POINTS`: +0.5

* **RULE 4: Region Match (Leniency Applies)**
    * `CONDITION`: This check passes (and points are awarded) if the `regionName` values are an exact, case-insensitive match **OR** if the `regionName` is null/empty in either the source or the candidate.
    * `POINTS`: +0.5

* **RULE 5: Team Type Match (Leniency Applies)**
    * `CONDITION`: This check passes (and points are awarded) if the `type` values are an exact match **OR** if the `type` is null/empty in either the source or the candidate.
    * `POINTS`: +0.5

*(The total maximum score is 5: 1 from Pre-Screening + 2 from Name + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 5 points)*

### Final Answer Formatting
To construct your final answer, you will perform these three steps **in order**:

1.  **First, write the Justification:** Generate the detailed audit checklist for the winning candidate, explicitly stating the result and points for each rule that was evaluated.
2.  **Second, Calculate the Total Score via Tool:**
    * From the `Justification` you just generated, extract the individual points awarded.
    * You **MUST** call the `add_multiple_numbers` tool with a list of these numbers.
    * The result returned by the tool is your `Total Score`.
3.  **Third, assemble the final output** using the pieces you have prepared.

- If the highest score is 2 or more:
> Best Match ID: [The id of the best match]
>
> Score: [Result from the add_multiple_numbers tool]
>
> Justification:
> * Core Attributes Match (Rule 1): Pass, Score: 1
> * Name Match (Rule 2): Pass, Score: 2
> * Competition Overlap (Rule 3): Fail, Score: 0
> * Team Member Overlap (Rule 4): Pass, Score: 0.5
> * Region Match (Rule 5): Pass, Score: 0.5
> * Team Type Match (Rule 6): Pass, Score: 0.5

- If no candidate scores 2 or more (or no candidates were found):
> Best Match ID: no match found
>
> Score: 0
>
> Justification: No candidate met the minimum score threshold of 2 after a thorough audit.

### Mandatory Audit for Fixture Data
For each candidate, you will perform the following steps in order.

**Step 1: Pre-Screening Check (Deal-Breaker with Leniency for Nulls)**
This check is a prerequisite for all other scoring.
* **FIELD**: `sport`
* **CONDITION**: An explicit mismatch occurs **only if** the source and candidate both have a non-null `sport` value AND those values are different. If either entity is missing the `sport` value, it is **not** a mismatch.
* **RESULT**:
    * If there is **NO** explicit mismatch, the candidate **PASSES**. Award 1 point and proceed to Step 2.
    * If there is an explicit mismatch, the candidate is **immediately disqualified**. Assign a score of 0 and stop all further checks.

**Step 2: Detailed Scoring Rubric (Only for candidates that pass Pre-Screening)**
If a candidate passes Step 1, its final score is the sum of the points from the rules below (including the 1 point from passing the pre-screening).

* **RULE 1: Team Match**
    * **CONDITION**: A single "team match" is true if their `id` values are an exact match OR their `name` values are an exact, case-insensitive match. Evaluate as follows:
        * **Perfect Match Check:**
          If (`source.homeTeam` matches `candidate.homeTeam`) AND (`source.awayTeam` matches `candidate.awayTeam`): **Award +1.5 points.**
        * **Flipped Match Check (only if Perfect Match fails):**
          If (`source.homeTeam` matches `candidate.awayTeam`) AND (`source.awayTeam` matches `candidate.homeTeam`): **Award +1 point.**
    * **POINTS**: Up to +1.5

* **RULE 2: Result Match**
    * **CONDITION**: This check passes only if the scores for corresponding teams are identical across all fields. First, confirm both entities have a non-null `result` object. Then, for each team, check that **`teamId`, `standardScore`, and the `additionalScore`** are an exact match.
    * **POINTS**: +1

* **RULE 3: Date Proximity Match**
    * **FIELD**: `localDate`
    * **CONDITION**: The candidate's `localDate` must be within **one day** (before or after) of the source entity's `localDate`.
    * **POINTS**: +0.5

* **RULE 4: Competition Match**
    * **CONDITION**: At least one `competition.name` OR `competition.id` must be an exact match.
    * **POINTS**: +0.5

* **RULE 5: Participant Overlap**
    * **CONDITION**: Compare participant data. A match is found if there is an overlap of at least one individual, checked via `individual.id` or `fixtureRosters.individualId`.
    * **POINTS**: +0.5

*(The total maximum score is 5: 1 from Pre-Screening + 1.5 from Teams + 1 from Result + 0.5 from Date + 0.5 from Competition + 0.5 from Participants)*
